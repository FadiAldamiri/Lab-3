**Big O Complexity in Context**

The brute-force string matching algorithm exhibits a worst-case time complexity of O(nm), where n represents the length of the text and m represents the length of the pattern. The worst-case scenario occurs when every possible position in the text must be examined before determining that no match exists, leading to decreased efficiency as the input size increases.

Correspondence Between Elapsed Time and Theoretical Big O

The measured elapsed time aligns with the expected O(nm) complexity. In the best-case scenario, where the pattern consists of a single character found at the beginning of the text, the time complexity is O(n) since the match is identified immediately, minimizing the number of comparisons. Conversely, in the worst-case scenario, where the pattern does not exist within the text, the complexity is O(nm) because the algorithm must scan the entire text while performing comparisons at each position, resulting in the maximum number of operations.

Objective of This Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to examine the behavior of the brute-force string matching algorithm under different input conditions. By comparing the algorithmâ€™s performance in best- and worst-case scenarios, the study aims to validate the theoretical time complexity through empirical execution time measurements. This analysis also highlights how input variations affect performance and reinforces the significance of algorithm efficiency in practical applications.

Sufficiency for Best- and Worst-Case Calculations

The current approach is sufficient for evaluating both best- and worst-case scenarios, as it assesses an immediate match, representing the best case, and a complete scan without a match, representing the worst case. However, a more comprehensive analysis would require additional testing with varying text and pattern lengths to further assess scalability and performance trends. Expanding the dataset would provide a clearer understanding of how input size influences execution time and would offer deeper insights into the limitations of brute-force string matching in large-scale applications.
